# â®± `Numerical Calculus Assignment`
This file aims the learning and practice of how to solve problems involving large systems of equations using numerical methods.
As part of the assignment, we were required to solve four questions.

## Summary of each question
* Implement the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel algorithms for solving systems of equations.
* Implement a Newton-based method for optimizing nonconvex functions to adjust a model.
* Utilize the least squares method to solve systems of equations.
* Apply Euler's and Runge-Kutta's methods to solve systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
