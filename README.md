# numericus-calculus
This is a file with the purpose of learning how to solve large system of equations problems with numerical solutions. 
As part of the assignment, we had to solve four questions.

## Summary of each question

* Implement Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel algorithms for systems of equations solutions.
*
* Use least squares method fo solving systems of equations.
* Use Euler and Runge-Kutta's methods for solving systems of ODE's.
